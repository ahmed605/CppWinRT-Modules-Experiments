# Modules Experiments

This is a repo for me to test using cppwinrt and C++20 modules. It's a work in progress. 

Right now, just go look at [ModulesExperiments](./ModulesExperiments) for the up-to-date state of the code, and [notes.md](notes.md) for my journal of notes (VERY stream-of-conciousness-y, be warned).
